# Cinema Popularity in Malaysia #

I retrieved data about cinemas in Malaysia from Twitter using Twitter Scraper package. 

This dataset have the top 4 cinema operators in Malaysia as a data point (47569 tweets in total), and for each, we have 21 columns, each column represents a different aspect or measure of the specific tweet.

The goal of the project is to understand this dataset, get some insights from it, and to improve my data analysis/manipulation skill set using Python.

# Brief background information about cinemas in Malaysia and Twitter

There are 5 major cinemas operator and their respective launched date in Malaysia, which are TGV (2006), GSC (2007), MBO (2003), Lotus FIVESTAR (2004) and mmCineplex (2008). In our analysis, we only use scraped twitter data from all of the above except for Lotus FIVESTAR because the amount scraped was insignificant compared to the other cinemas (not enough people tweeting about Lotus FiveSTAR in Malaysia.
